* Load a pre-trained model (either VGG16 or VGG19 or InceptionV3)
* Check its accuracy using weights of `imagnet` dataset only on CIFAR10 dataset.
> Problem you will face, try to resolve it as well : imagnet had 1000 classes whereas CIFAR10 has only 10 classes
* Transfer Learning : Fine-Tune the chosen pre-trained model on CIFAR10 and then compare them
