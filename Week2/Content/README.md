# ML
### For New Learners
* **Learn what is ML from scratch :**[ML course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
* **Learn basics of Neural Networks :**[Advanced Learning Algorithms on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

### For One who Knows Basic ML
* **This book has it all. You can refer to the ML Basics section and Chapters 6 to 8 for Deep Learning.** [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

## Or You may refer lectures by Andrew Ng on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6FNC6YRfRQc_FbeQrF8BwGI)
## Or You may refer first 4 videos from [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) playlist on YouTube by 3Blue1Brown

**Once you are done with neural networks try to make some with this interactive website, try out various combination of parameters and activation, notice test and train graphs carefully.  [playground.tensorflow.org](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.05720&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false)**

> **Try to finish upto Neural Nets and CNN by this week.** 

# CNNs
* **Refer first 11(Bare Minimum) lectures by Andrew Ng from this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF)**
