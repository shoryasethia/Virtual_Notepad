## Once you have covered [theory](https://github.com/shoryasethia/Virtual_Notepad/edit/main/Week2/Content), you can start following tasks


### - Tensorflow baiscs for Neural Networks (MLPs): No need to code [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner). Just read and understand how we use tensorflow API's to form model, load data and save model.
### - Tensorflow baiscs for image classification by CNNs : No need to code [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn).
### - Overfitting and underfitting : Go through [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit)
### - How to save a trained model and load a pre-trained model : Go through [this](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load)
