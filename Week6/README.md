### Make a virtual notepad/canvas.
### Predict the digit you using models trained on let's say on MNIST.
### To make model robust, use multiple models (like 3 or 5 models), let each model predict and at the end just take their voting. This will make our model robust. This is not exactly similar to ensemble learning but yeas, it is can be referred as ensemble as of now.
