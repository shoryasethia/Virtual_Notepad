## Make a virtual notepad/canvas.
### Predict the digit using models trained on let's say on MNIST.
### To make model robust, use multiple models (like 3 or 5 models), let each model predict and at the end just take their voting. This will make our model robust. This is not exactly similar to ensemble learning but yeas, it is can be referred as ensemble as of now.
> Refer [this](https://github.com/shoryasethia/Virtual_Notepad/blob/main/Week6/voting.ipynb) for conducting voting.
### Display prediction on the canvas itself. Make a some sort of button or unique hand gesture, whenever you hover your hand there, it predicts only then.

## You are allowed to make it more complex
### But I would recommend to start with MNIST first.
### Once this works, combine features like volume, maybe an screenshot sort button, save button, exit button. Moreover, add 2-3 unique functionalities to it.

Project submission involves
1. Codes
2. Video Demonstration
3. Brief report on Project + SoC learnings
> Don't copy code, try to it by yourself and don't upload others video. In previous assignment, 3 people have copied each others work and 2 people submitted the same video demo. I hope this doesn't happen this time.
