## SoC : Gesture based text creation [ Project ID: 102 ] aka Virtual Notepad and recognition

## Simplest of simplest Version of our project would be like [this](https://github.com/shoryasethia/Virtual_Notepad/blob/main/Simplest-Version-of-Project.mp4)



### Tentative Timeline
* Week1: Python programming and introduction to libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib along with fundamentals of machine learning 
* Week2: Introduction to OpenCV, including reading and displaying images along with fundamentals of Neural Network architectures 
* Week3: OpenCV Continutation and Creating a blank canvas using OpenCV and capturing video input from a webcam 
* Week4: Develop a custom hand detection module using mediapipe and using OpenCV to identify hand movements and gestures on the canvas, and use them for implementing tasks
* Week5: Training a rigorous custom CNN model on various datasets for letter, digit recognition. 
* Week6: Intro to Image preprocessing techniques such as converting to grayscale, resizing, and normalization. Merging Canvas output with CNN model preciction.
* Week7: Integrating the trained model with the OpenCV code for real-time character recognition on the canvas and adding object detection methods like SSD or Yolo as well for text/word or number recognition.
* Week8: Buffer, Refinement/Modification and documentation
